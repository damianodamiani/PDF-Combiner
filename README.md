# PDF-Combiner
A simple Python script to combine multiple PDF files into one PDF file.

## How to use
1. Open the Python script in your code editor.
2. In `pdf_files = ["file1.pdf", "file2.pdf", "file3.pdf"]` replace file1.pdf etc. with the actual file paths of the PDFs you want to merge. You can, of course, add more or less files than three; simply continue adding more PDF file paths following the same pattern.
4. In `output_pdf = "PDF_combined.pdf"` replace PDF_combined.pdf with the desired name for the merged PDF file.
5. In `output_directory = "/path/to/output/directory/"` replace /path/to/output/directory/ with your desired output directory path for the merged PDF file.
6. Save the script and you're ready to go.

## Requirements
To run this Python scripts you need to have the PyPDF2 library in your terminal, you can install it using pip: `pip install PyPDF2`.
